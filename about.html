			<h1>My name is Bill, this is my website.</h1>
			<p>I am a 24 year old software engineer. I am powered by tea and video games.</p>
			<p>I hail from New Jersey, and I harbor a great love for the state. That doesn't mean, however, that I want to live here forever.</p>
			<p>I am a trained bartender, though in all honesty probably not a very good one. Maybe someday I will tend professionally, until then I will continue making drinks for myself and my friends. I like liquor, wine, and beer, and I like coming up with strange cocktails with silly names.</p>
			<p>I like programming, and I like video games. My dream job would probably be as a game developer, although the things I've heard about that industry make it seem extremely toxic. If I become a dev, it will likely be a side-project that I do concurrently with a real job.</p>
			<p>I enjoy music. You probably could have guessed, given that all human beings enjoy music, but I enjoy it so much that I thought it deserved an explicit mention. If you asked me what kind of music I liked, I would sarcastically say "Everything but rap and country lol", but that's actually pretty accurate.</p>
			<p>I also play music. From where I'm sitting, I can see a bagpipes, a clarinet, an alto saxophone, a cello, three guitars, three bass guitars, and a mandolin. I know how to play all of them save the bagpipes, which are highly frustrating, and also I live in an apartment so I can't play them ever.</p>
