			<h1>Computer programming is my forte. As you can see, web design clearly isn't.</h1>
			<p>The language about which I know the most is Java, if only because I've used it for the longest period of time. I also used it in college, and it's the only language I use in my current job. I can use many Java-related technologies, such as Spring, JAXB, JSPs, JPA, JDBC, and many J-prefixed acronyms besides.</p>
			<p>I also have professional experience with XML, XML Schema, and RESTful web services. I'm most comfortable with Oracle, Weblogic, and the whole awful, awful Oracle stack.</p>
			<hr />
			<p>Java sucks, though. It, no, I'm sorry, it does. There are many other languages that run faster and many that are easier to write and many that are more powerful and many that are more concise.</p>
			<p>Chiefly among these is Javascript. Probably not in the speed department, but it seems easier to turn my thoughts into code when I'm writing Javascript. I know basic JS, I'm learning node, and I aim to learn Ember or Angular as well.</p>
			<p>Additionally, I know a good amount of Perl, a touch of C++, a hint of Python, a dab of Perl 6, and a tiny pinch of Lisp (okay, Scheme (okay fine it was Racket)). Also shell scripting? That seems like a given though.</p>
