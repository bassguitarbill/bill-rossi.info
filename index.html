			<p>Okay, hi, welcome to my webpage. Click a link up top if you w-no, you obviously knew that. You're a smart person, you knew the instant you came to this page that those buttons were links. And you've probably already clicked one. If you wanted to see my skills, you clicked 'skills', and so on. No, the only reason you're still reading this is because you feel like reading stupid prose. So, thanks I guess. I like writing stupid prose, so at least somebody likes to read it.</p>
			<p>Thank you for reading this far. It means a lot to me.</p>
